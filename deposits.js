/*
Here we will look at how to accept Toncoin deposits. Each user will have their own deposit address.

1. You once generated a key pair and get corresponding address of your HOT wallet as described in the `common.js`.
   All payments from the user will first go to the user's deposit wallet, and then go to the HOT wallet.

2. When your user has to pay, you generate new wallet for him (as described in `common.js`) and store keys in your database.

3. You tell the user - please send N Toncoins to this wallet address.
   You can use a deeplink, by clicking on which the user will open the wallet app with all the fields filled in, if the wallet app is installed.
   ton://transfer/<wallet_address>?amount=<amount_in_nano>

4. Your backend is constantly subscribed to blocks appearing on the network.
   It is convenient to use the Index HTTP API of toncenter.com: https://toncenter.com/api/index/# or https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/index/#

5. Your backend iterates the transactions of each block, and if the transaction occurred on one of the deposit wallets, it is processed as a deposit.
   For security, we double-check each deposit transaction (its parameters and that the transaction exists) with an additional direct request to the node.
